Los Techies Angular Example
===========================

I found [a series of blog posts by Los Techies][los-techies] on how to
write [AngularJS][angular] applications, and I wanted to follow along.
This repository just contains the example code from these guides, as I
reproduce the code to help me become more familiar with AngularJS.
